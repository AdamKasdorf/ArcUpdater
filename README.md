ArcUpdater is a command-line tool to check for, download, and validate updates to ArcDPS.

If executed with no optional command-line arguments, runs a standard check and install/update to the current working directory.

Accepts multiple path arguments, and supports environment variable expansion and relative paths.

Moves existing assemblies to the Recycle Bin by default rather than deleting/overwriting. Can be overriden with the --del option.

Use command --help or -? for complete help information.
